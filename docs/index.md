## About

This website should provide a more or less comprehensive guide to using LSA templates for:

* <em>Proceedings of the Linguistic Society of America</em> (by Sarah E. Murray, Patrick Farrell, Daniil M. Ozernyi)
* <em> Phonological Data and Analysis </em> (by Daniil M. Ozernyi, Patrick Farrell, Laura R. Faircloth)

At the same time, it should cover the basis of most packages needed for classroom use. (TikZ is not discussed, as is BiBLaTeX, however.) The stress is on Overleaf, which is (arguably) easier for beginners. Hopefully, this will encourage more people to use (La)TeX.

### Disclaimer: If you are already using LaTeX locally, there's probably nothing new for you here. Just fork and clone from the GitHub page if need be (you'll only need PDA or PLSA folder though).
